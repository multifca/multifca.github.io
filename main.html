        <h3>Profile:</h3>
        Born and raised in Toronto, I made the jump into real estate to share my knowledge and passion for this amazing city with my clients. I’m lucky to have lived all over Toronto while I was growing up, which has given me such appreciation and understanding of what each neighbourhood has to offer. My professional background is in mortgage financing, where I worked as a Residential Mortgage Underwriter for over 5 years. With this, I’m able to offer complete expertise to my clients, knowing what goes into a purchase from each side of the transaction.  
        

        <h3>Mission statement: </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>To offer sufficient data and market intelligence you need to make smart property choices</li>
            <li>To make it easier to buy properties anywhere</li>
            <li>To enhance quality of life for everyone</li>

        </ul>
